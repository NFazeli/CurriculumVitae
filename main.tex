With my diverse background in Science and Engineering I have strong expertise in statistics and programming. 
As a curious researcher I enjoy to challenge myself with new topics and employ my problem-solving skills to bring the given task to the next level.
After several years in fundamental research, I am now looking forward to move to a faster paced environment. 
I have a learner's spirit, feeling enthusiastic about the opportunities to become an expert in agile software development and AI.

\section{Work Experience}
\cventry{since 04/2016}{Research Assistant}{I. Physikalisches Institut, University of Cologne}{Germany}{}{My research was part of an international collaboration studying the mechanisms that lead to feeding and feedback of supermassive black holes especially in the nearby universe.
During my research I gained experience on data reduction, analysis and visualization working with large observational data sets from the world's foremost astronomical observatories. For this I developed my own Python scripts and modified existing pipelines. I presented the results of my research at many international conferences and published papers in leading astronomical journals.}
\cventry{2014-2016}{Student assistant in admissions office}{Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy}{}{}{For this job I prepared applicants profiles for the selecting Committee under strict deadlines.
Created and maintained database for the admission office, using Microsoft Excel and Access.
Organized events during the admission academy week and communicated with students and staff.
Consulted students about rules, regulations and opportunities at University of Cologne. 
Provided administrative support services to students during semester start-ups.}
